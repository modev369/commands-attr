Here is a summary of some common input/output (I/O) commands and filters used in shell scripting with attributes:

I/O Commands:
                    
                          echo  : prints a message to the standard output (stdout)
                          read  : reads input from the standard input (stdin  )
                          printf: formats and prints data to stdout
                          cat   : concatenates and displays files to stdout
                          touch : creates an empty file or updates a file's modification timestamp





I/O Redirection:
                          >          : redirects the stdout of a command to a file
                          >>         : appends the stdout of a command to a file
                          <          : redirects the contents of a file to the stdin of a command
                          |          : pipes the stdout of one command to the stdin of another command
                          
                          
                          
                          
Filters:
                      grep: searches for a pattern or regular expression in a file or output, with attributes such as:
                                  -A: displays n lines after the matched line
                                  -B: displays n lines before the matched line
                                  -v: displays lines that do not match the pattern
                                  -i: ignores case sensitivity when matching patterns
                                  -E: uses extended regular expressions
                      sed: stream editor that modifies the output based on patterns, with attributes such as:
                                  -n: suppresses automatic printing of pattern space
                                  -e: executes the following command
                      awk: text processing tool that operates on fields of input, with attributes such as:
                                  -F: sets the field separator
                                  -v: assigns a value to a variable
                      cut: extracts columns or fields from input based on a delimiter, with attributes such as:
                                  -d: sets the delimiter
                                  -f: selects a field or column
                      sort: sorts the input in ascending or descending order, with attributes such as:
                                  -r: sorts in reverse order
                                  -n: sorts numerically
                      uniq: removes duplicate lines from the input, with attributes such as:
                                  -c: displays the count of each line
                                  -d: displays only the duplicated lines
                      head: displays the first n lines of the input, with attributes such as:
                                  -n: sets the number of lines to display
                      tail: displays the last n lines of the input, with attributes such as:
                                   -n: sets the number of lines to display
